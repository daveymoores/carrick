# Comma-separated list of valid API keys for authentication
# Generate secure random keys for production use
carrick_api_keys = "dev-key-123,ci-key-456,prod-key-789"

# AWS region where resources will be deployed
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Environment name (affects resource naming)

# Example of how to generate secure API keys:
# openssl rand -hex 32
# or use a password manager to generate random strings
