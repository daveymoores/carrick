//! Deterministic GraphQL contract extraction.
//!
//! Producers are SDL schemas: `.graphql`/`.gql` files and `gql`/`graphql`
//! tagged template literals containing type-system definitions. Consumers are
//! executable documents: tagged template literals and `.graphql` files
//! containing operations. Everything here is parse-based — no LLM. Sources
//! that fail to parse (e.g. documents with interpolations mid-token) are
//! skipped silently: per the brittleness guardrails, drift findings may only
//! come from deterministic evidence, so a miss is a coverage gap, never a
//! false positive.
//!
//! Out of scope by design: Relay compiled artifacts and persisted-query
//! manifests (no document in source), and code-first schemas
//! (Pothos/TypeGraphQL/Nexus) unless an emitted `schema.graphql` is
//! committed — the formatter suggests committing one when GraphQL libraries
//! are detected but no operations were extracted.
