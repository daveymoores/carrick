//! File-centric analyzer agent for high-speed static analysis using Gemini 3.0 Flash.
//!
//! NOTE: This module is part of a refactoring effort. The public API will be integrated
//! with the orchestrator in subsequent commits.
#![allow(dead_code)]
//!
//! This agent implements a "one-shot" analysis approach where an entire file is sent
//! to the LLM along with framework-specific patterns. The LLM returns structured
//! findings that can be directly deserialized into graph structures.
//!
//! Key features:
//! - Framework agnostic: All detection logic derives from injected patterns
//! - Alias resolution: Import sources are tracked for cross-file linking
//! - Flat schema: Avoids recursion errors and ensures deterministic parsing

- "endpoints": array of HTTP endpoint definitions found
- "data_calls": array of data fetching calls found
- "pubsub_operations": array of pub/sub publish/subscribe operations found

For each mount, include: line_number, parent_node, child_node, mount_path, import_source (null if local), pattern_matched

For each endpoint, include: candidate_id, line_number, owner_node, method, path, handler_name, pattern_matched,
response_expression_text, response_expression_line, payload_expression_text, payload_expression_line,
primary_type_symbol, type_import_source
  - Echo candidate_id from the candidate context
  - MUST emit response_expression_text: copy the EXACT payload subexpression (e.g., "users" from res.json(users), ctx.body = users, h.response(users), or return users). Emit null for payload-less handlers.
  - MUST emit response_expression_line: read the line number from the prefix in the source code (line where the payload subexpression appears)
  - For payload_expression_text: copy the EXACT expression for the request payload (e.g., "req.body")
  - For payload_expression_line: read the line number from the prefix

For each data_call, include: candidate_id, line_number, target, method (null if unknown), pattern_matched,
call_expression_text, call_expression_line, payload_expression_text, payload_expression_line,
primary_type_symbol, type_import_source
  - Echo candidate_id from the candidate context
  - MUST emit call_expression_text: copy the EXACT text of the fetch/axios/HTTP call (e.g., 'fetch("/api/users")')
  - MUST emit call_expression_line: read the line number from the prefix
  - For payload_expression_text: copy the EXACT payload argument text if detected
  - For payload_expression_line: read the line number from the prefix

For each pubsub_operation, include: topic, role, line_number, primary_type_symbol, type_import_source, broker
  - topic: the literal topic/channel/subject string (resolve a named const like TOPIC to its string literal)
  - role: "publisher" if the code SENDS a payload to a topic, "subscriber" if it REGISTERS a handler for a topic
  - line_number: read the line number from the prefix in the source code
  - primary_type_symbol: the DECODED application payload type (unwrap envelope/transport wrappers and wire types down to the inner named type); null if untyped
  - type_import_source: import path where primary_type_symbol is defined (from the import table), or null if local; null whenever primary_type_symbol is null
  - broker: the messaging library/transport if evident (e.g. "kafka"), else null
